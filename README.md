angular-freebase-lookup
=======================

A quick music lookup application that uses freebase as a data source.

##Description 
This application will query freebase for an artist and return all of the albums from that artist. From there, if any of the albums are selected, a page with the album details will load showing things like tracks, release, images, and other items.

##Installation
Theoretically you should be able to run this with out a web server. There may be some issues with the JSONP and cross domain calls, however, so it dosen't hurt to have it up on a simple web server somewhere.

Simply clone the repository into a folder routable by your web server and navigate to that path. Please note that freebase is rate limited and that you can include your own license key to increase the calls you can make to freebase.
